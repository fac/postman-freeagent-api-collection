# Postman Collection for the FreeAgent API

Please refer to the official FreeAgent API docs:
https://dev.freeagent.com/docs

> **IMPORTANT:** postman is available as a web application (https://www.postman.com/) or a desktop application running on Windows, Mac etc. The web application has a different OAuth 2.0 redirect URI to the desktop application. 

### Get Started

1. Create an application using your [FreeAgent Developer Dashboard](https://dev.freeagent.com/). Ensure the following **OAuth redirect URIs** are listed (add them if missing). They can be listed in any order.
- https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
- https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/browser-callback
- https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback

    The google URI is not required for this postman collection but if you want to use your application with the [Google OAuth Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) - as described in the [FreeAgent Developer Quick Start](https://dev.freeagent.com/docs/quick_start) - then you need it.

    The `oauth.pstmn.io` URL is required for the postman web application. The last one is required for the postman desktop application. Listing all 3 means you are good for any scenario.

2. Import the FreeAgent collection

3. Import the environment file(s) for sandbox and/or production and/or development (but see [Common Postman Gotchas](#common-postman-gotchas) below). Fill in the environment variables for `client_id`
and `client_secret` from your app (which you created in step 1).

4. Generate access and refresh tokens by:
- right-clicking on the collection > Edit > `Authorization`
- click `Get New Access Token`, signing in with an account for the appropriate environment, then click `Proceed`
- and finally `Use Token`.

#### Common Gotchas
If your attempt to obtain an access token fails with the `"HTTP Basic: Access denied."` error, check your environment file and ensure the `client_id` and `client_secret` are entered correctly and don't contain any trailing whitespace/newline characters.

#### Common Postman Gotchas

The web and desktop applications work slightly differently e.g. you right-click items in the desktop app but in the web app you single-click icons.

I think the web application is more usable as it caches the username & password you enter when filling out the application authorization web form, so saving typing. You also get browser developr tools for free!

##### Environment Variables Not Working Correctly

There is an outstanding postman bug where environment variables are not resolved when sending requests:
[Environment variable not being resolved when sending request #6001](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/6001)

There are a number of work-arounds. The simplest is to:
- Import the environment as described above (so you know what variables are defined)
- Create a new environment manually; define the required variables in the new environment
- Delete the imported environment

##### Environment Is INACTIVE By Default

You need to tick the checkbox next to the environment to mark it as **active** so that its variables will be resolved by the Postman collection.


### Refreshing the Access Token Automatically

You can set up a [pre-request script](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/scripts/pre-request-scripts/) if you'd like to automate the process of refreshing your access token once it expires. To do this:

- In Postman's left-hand panel, under **Collections**, click on the icon with three dots next to the name of the imported FreeAgent collection
- Select **Edit**
- Open the **Pre-request Scripts** tab and paste in the contents of [auto_refresh_script.js](./auto_refresh_script.js)
- Click **Update** to save
- You'll now have to set up a few environment variables, which you can do by clicking on the eye symbol next to the
environment dropdown in the top-left corner of the Postman app. For each FreeAgent environment you have set up, ensure you have the following variables:

  - `client_id` - your app's OAuth identifier from your Developer Dashboard account
  - `client_secret` - your app's OAuth secret from your Developer Dashboard account
  - `token_url` - token endpoint for the right environment, e.g. `https://api.sandbox.freeagent.com/v2/token_endpoint`
  - `refresh_token` - a valid refresh token for that environment

- Navigate back on the FreeAgent collection **Edit** screen, go to the **Authorization** tab and enter the `{{access_token}}` variable into the **Access Token** field. Click **Update**.

From now on your access token will be refreshed automatically! ðŸŽ‰
